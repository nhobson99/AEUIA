# AEUIA
Turing Machine (Arithmetic Expression User Input Analyzer)

AEUIA Final.txt:

  Contains color coding and 3 error states:
  
    Error 0: Unmatched parentheses in middle of input (points out error)
    
    Error 1: Two or more subsequent arithmetic operators (+, -, /, \*) (points out error)
    
    Error 2: Extra parenthese at end of input (does not point out error)
    
  All error states are accept states to keep the Turing machine from ending unsuccessfully
